            The ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that
            solves business problems and meets technical requirements. This
            encompasses proficiency in one or more programming languages,
            understanding of data structures and algorithms, and application
            of software design principles. Practitioners translate requirements
            into working software, optimize code performance, and ensure code
            quality through testing and peer review processes.
          key_elements:
            - "Writing syntactically correct and logically sound code"

        why_it_matters: |
          Programming is the foundational capability that enables all software
          delivery. High-quality code reduces maintenance costs, improves system
          reliability, and accelerates feature delivery. Poor programming practices
          result in technical debt that compounds over time, eventually slowing
          innovation and increasing operational risk.

            The ability to design software systems that are scalable, reliable,
            maintainable, and aligned with business requirements. This includes
            understanding of architectural patterns, system decomposition,
            integration approaches, and non-functional requirements. Practitioners
            create technical designs that balance competing concerns, communicate
            architecture decisions effectively, and ensure systems integrate
            properly with existing technology ecosystems.

          Sound architecture enables systems to evolve with changing requirements
          while maintaining performance and reliability. Poor architectural decisions
          create systemic issues that are expensive to remediate and can limit
          business agility. Good architecture reduces complexity, enables team
          autonomy, and supports long-term maintainability.

            The ability to ensure software quality through systematic testing,
            validation, and quality practices. This includes designing test
            strategies, writing automated tests, performing various testing
            types (unit, integration, system, performance), and implementing
            quality gates in development processes. Practitioners identify
            defects early, validate requirements are met, and maintain
            confidence in system behavior through comprehensive test coverage.

            - "Analyzing test results and coverage metrics"
            - "Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines"

        why_it_matters: |
          Quality assurance prevents defects from reaching production, protecting
          customer experience and business reputation. Automated testing enables
          rapid, confident deployments while manual testing catches subtle issues.
          Strong QA practices reduce the cost of defects by catching them early
          and enable sustainable development velocity.

              CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern software delivery.
              Effective pipelines enable rapid iteration, reduce deployment
              risk, and free developers to focus on value creation. Poor
              pipelines slow delivery, introduce risk, and frustrate teams.

      Technical competencies focus on the application of technical skills and
      knowledge to solve problems and deliver solutions. Leadership competencies
      focus on influencing others, building relationships, and driving
      organizational outcomes. This section clarifies boundaries to prevent
      overlap between the two domains.
