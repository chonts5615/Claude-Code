# JOB FAMILY COMPETENCY MODEL SCHEMA
# =============================================================================
# This schema defines the structure for a comprehensive competency model
# designed for a specific job family. The model serves as the foundation
# from which role-specific competencies are generated based on Job Descriptions.
#
# Version: 1.0
# Purpose: Provide structured competency framework for GPT-based generation
