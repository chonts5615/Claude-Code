# Criticality Scoring Rubric

This rubric defines how competencies are scored on criticality factors.

## Scoring Factors (Weighted)

### 1. Coverage (25%)

**Definition**: Percentage of job responsibilities enabled by this competency

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: Enables 80%+ of responsibilities
- 0.7-0.9: Enables 60-79% of responsibilities
- 0.5-0.7: Enables 40-59% of responsibilities
- 0.3-0.5: Enables 20-39% of responsibilities
- 0.0-0.3: Enables <20% of responsibilities

### 2. Impact/Risk (20%)

**Definition**: Consequence of inadequate competency performance

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: Critical - Business/safety/compliance failure
- 0.7-0.9: High - Major project/customer impact
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate - Delays or quality issues
- 0.3-0.5: Low - Minor inefficiencies
- 0.0-0.3: Minimal - Negligible impact

### 3. Frequency (15%)

**Definition**: How often competency is used

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: Daily/continuous use
- 0.7-0.9: Weekly use
- 0.5-0.7: Monthly use
- 0.3-0.5: Quarterly use
- 0.0-0.3: Rarely/annually

### 4. Complexity (15%)

**Definition**: Cognitive/technical difficulty level

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: Expert - Requires advanced expertise, rare skill
- 0.7-0.9: Advanced - Requires significant training/experience
- 0.5-0.7: Intermediate - Moderate learning curve
- 0.3-0.5: Basic - Straightforward with some training
- 0.0-0.3: Foundational - Simple, widely available skill

### 5. Differentiation (15%)

**Definition**: Distinguishes high performers from average

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: Key differentiator - Separates top 10%
- 0.7-0.9: Strong differentiator - Separates top 25%
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate differentiator - Visible performance variance
- 0.3-0.5: Minor differentiator - Some performance variance
- 0.0-0.3: Non-differentiator - Expected baseline

### 6. Time to Proficiency (10%)

**Definition**: Time required to develop competency

**Scoring**:
- 0.9-1.0: 3+ years to proficiency
- 0.7-0.9: 1-3 years to proficiency
- 0.5-0.7: 6-12 months to proficiency
- 0.3-0.5: 3-6 months to proficiency
- 0.0-0.3: <3 months to proficiency

## Total Criticality Score

**Formula**:
```
Total Score = (Coverage × 0.25) +
              (Impact × 0.20) +
              (Frequency × 0.15) +
              (Complexity × 0.15) +
              (Differentiation × 0.15) +
              (Time to Proficiency × 0.10)
```

**Interpretation**:
- 0.80-1.00: Critical competency
- 0.60-0.79: Important competency
- 0.40-0.59: Useful competency
- 0.20-0.39: Supporting competency
- 0.00-0.19: Optional competency

## Usage Notes

- Scores are context-dependent (vary by role, industry, org)
- Document rationale for each factor score
- Review with subject matter experts
- Calibrate across jobs for consistency
