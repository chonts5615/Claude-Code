# Quality gate thresholds

# Step 1 - Job Extraction
job_extraction:
  min_responsibilities_per_job: 5
  max_missing_summary_rate: 0.10

# Step 2 - Competency Mapping
competency_mapping:
  max_unmapped_responsibility_rate: 0.05
  min_candidates_per_responsibility: 1

# Step 4/5 - Overlap Detection
overlap:
  material_threshold: 0.82  # >= this is material overlap
  minor_threshold: 0.72     # between minor and material
  distinctness_duplicate: 0.88  # within-job duplicate threshold

# Step 7 - Ranking
ranking:
  top_n_competencies: 8
  min_responsibility_coverage: 0.80
  min_competencies_per_job: 6
  max_competencies_per_job: 10
